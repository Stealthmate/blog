## Step 2 - Showing your ~~true~~ interpolated colors

Alright. So we have established that our image sensor produces an 8000x6000 grid of voltage values. And we also came to the realization that these numbers do _not_ tell us anything about color.

**So how the hell are camera images so colorful?**

The answer is filters.

(_No, not the Instagram ones._)



What you may _not_ know, is that while this is technically true, it may not match your immediate interpretation.

(_This is common knowledge in 2023, right?_)

You see, a 48MP (8000x6000) sensor does indeed have 48 million pixels, but they
